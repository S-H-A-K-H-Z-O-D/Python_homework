    "### Working With Database Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t usually want to create a whole database just to get the current time. Databases are used to store and retrieve information. To store data in a database, you need to create a table and write some values to it.\n",

    "Let’s create a table called People with three columns: FirstName, LastName, and Age. The SQL query to create this table looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE People(FirstName TEXT, LastName TEXT, Age INT);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that FirstName and LastName are followed by the word TEXT, whereas Age is followed by the word INT. This tells SQLite that values in the FirstName and LastName columns are text values, while values in the Age column are integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you create the table, you can populate it with data using the INSERT INTO SQL command. The following query inserts the values Ron, Obvious, and 42 in the FirstName, LastName, and Age columns, respectively:\n",

    "```\n",

    "If you have a particular type of SQL database that you’d like to access through Python, most of the basic syntax is likely to be identical to what you just learned for SQLite. However, you’ll need to install an additional package to interact with your database since SQLite is the\n",

    "\n",
    "Many SQL variants and corresponding Python packages are available. Here are a few of the most commonly used and reliable open source alternatives to SQLite:\n",
    "-  `pyodbc` connects to ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) databases, such as Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "-  `psycopg2` connects to PostgreSQL databases.\n",
    "- `PyMySQL` connects to MySQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "One difference between SQLite and other database engines—besides the actual syntax of the SQL code, which changes slightly with most flavors of SQL—is that most database engines require a username and a password to connect. Check the documentation for the particular package you want to use to get the proper syntax for making a database connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SQLAlchemy` package is another popular option for working with databases. SQLAlchemy is an object-relational mapper, or ORM, that uses an object-oriented paradigm to build database queries. It can be configured to connect to a variety of databases. The object-oriented approach allows you to make queries without writing raw SQL statements."
